# VSStoGIT

### NOTE: This script was written in PowerShell 5.1. It is recommended that you install the latest version of PowerShell as the API is constantly changing. Tested on Windows 10 and windows 7. (May or not work with Linux/MacOS).

A Powershell script that can migrate (gasp) Microsoft SourceSafe repositories to Git. This aims to retain as much history as possible from the SourceSafe repository. At the top of the VSStoGit script there are set-up variables that will need to be modified in order to point the script to the correct SourceSafe and Git repositories. Once configured, hit run and enjoy!
